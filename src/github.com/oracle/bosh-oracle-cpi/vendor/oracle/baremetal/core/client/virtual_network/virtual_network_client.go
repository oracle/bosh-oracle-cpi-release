CreateCpe creates cpe

Creates a new virtual Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE) object in the specified compartment. For
more information, see [Managing IPSec VPNs](/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want
the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec
connection or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to
use, put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about
compartments and access control, see [Overview of the IAM Service](/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
For information about OCIDs, see [Resource Identifiers](/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You must provide the public IP address of your on-premise router. See
[Configuring Your On-Premise Router](/Content/Network/Tasks/configuringCPE.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the CPE, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to
be unique, and you can change it.

Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see

For the VCN you must specify a single, contiguous IPv4 CIDR block in the private IP address ranges specified in
[RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16.
The CIDR block can range from /16 to /30, and it must not overlap with your on-premise network. You can't
change the size of the VCN after creation.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the VCN to
reside. Consult an Oracle Bare Metal Cloud Services administrator in your organization if you're not sure which
compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other
Networking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about OCIDs, see

Creates a new virtual circuit to use with Oracle Bare Metal Cloud
Services FastConnect. For more information, see
[FastConnect Overview](/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the virtual circuit to reside. If you're
not sure which compartment to use, put the virtual circuit in the
same compartment with the DRG it's using. For more information about
compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
For information about OCIDs, see
[Resource Identifiers](/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the virtual circuit.
It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.

**Important:** When creating a virtual circuit, you specify a DRG for
the traffic to flow through. Make sure you attach the DRG to your
VCN and confirm the VCN's routing sends traffic to the DRG. Otherwise
traffic will not flow. For more information, see
[Managing Route Tables](/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm).
